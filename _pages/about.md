I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Xiaojing Liao](https://www.xiaojingliao.com/). 
My primary research interests lie at the intersection of cybersecurity, machine learning, and natural language processing. Specifically, I focus on the following areas:

1. Sociotechnical, with a focus on cybercrime and privacy compliance checks.
2. Trustworthy machine learning, particularly in robustness, privacy, and their interconnections.
3. Data-driven privacy and security, especially for threat intelligence gathering and analysis.

My long-term research goal is to discover and understand critical security and privacy issues in cybersystems or AI systems through data-oriented analysis and to design and develop innovative solutions to address these issues with robust, private guarantees for different real-world applications.
